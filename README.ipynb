    "# What is Cachew?\n",
    "TLDR: cachew lets you **cache function calls** into an sqlite database on your disk in a matter of **single decorator** (similar to [functools.lru_cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache)). The difference from `functools.lru_cache` is that cached data is persisted between program runs, so next time you call your function, it will only be a matter of reading from the cache.\n",
    "Cache is **invalidated automatically** if your function's arguments change, so you don't have to think about maintaining it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be cacheable, your function needs to return a simple data type, or an [Iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Iterator) over such types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple type is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- primitive: `str`/`int`/`float`/`bool`\n",
    "- JSON-like types (`dict`/`list`/`tuple`)\n",
    "- `datetime`\n",
    "- `Exception` (useful for [error handling](https://beepb00p.xyz/mypy-error-handling.html#kiss) )\n",
    "- [NamedTuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple)\n",
    "- [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That allows to **automatically infer schema from type hints** ([PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526)) and not think about serializing/deserializing.\n",
    "Thanks to type hints, you don't need to annotate your classes with any special decorators, inherit from some special base classes, etc., as it's often the case for serialization libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I often find myself processing big chunks of data, merging data together, computing some aggregates on it or extracting few bits I'm interested at. While I'm trying to utilize REPL as much as I can, some things are still fragile and often you just have to rerun the whole thing in the process of development. This can be frustrating if data parsing and processing takes seconds, let alone minutes in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventional way of dealing with it is serializing results along with some sort of hash (e.g. md5) of input files,\n",
    "comparing on the next run and returning cached data if nothing changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple as it sounds, it is pretty tedious to do every time you need to memorize some data, contaminates your code with routine and distracts you from your main task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples\n",
    "## Processing Wikipedia\n",
    "Imagine you're working on a data analysis pipeline for some huge dataset, say, extracting urls and their titles from Wikipedia archive.\n",
    "Parsing it (`extract_links` function) takes hours, however, as long as the archive is same you will always get same results. So it would be nice to be able to cache the results somehow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this library your can achieve it through single `@cachew` decorator."
